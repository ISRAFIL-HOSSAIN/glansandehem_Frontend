The time it takes to carry out the cleaning at your particular home has to do with how big your home is.\n\n Our staff brings cleaning products and rags. We leave the rags with you after your first cleaning, so that you can wash them yourself for the next cleaning. \n\n What you need at home is a mop, bucket and vacuum cleaner. We would also like you to tell us, before your cleaning, which areas you want us to put extra emphasis on in your home."

      "question": "What is artificial intelligence (AI)?",
      "answer":
        "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation."

    {
      "question": "How does machine learning differ from traditional programming?",
      "answer":
        "In traditional programming, explicit instructions are provided to a computer to perform a task. In contrast, machine learning allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed, making it well-suited for complex, data-driven tasks."

      "question": "What are the potential ethical concerns associated with AI?",
      "answer":
        "Ethical concerns in AI include issues related to bias in algorithms, privacy implications, job displacement, and the responsible use of autonomous systems. Addressing these concerns requires a combination of technical advancements, policy development, and ongoing collaboration between industry, academia, and regulatory bodies."
